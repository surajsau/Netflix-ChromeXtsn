A Google chrome extension to easily manage your 'Watched' list of Movies and Shows

## Download Instructions
Download zip from this [link](https://github.com/surajsau/WatchedFlix/archive/v0.0.1.zip) for the latest version. Unzip it and follow the instructions in (this page)[https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted].

Older versions are available in the [Release](https://github.com/surajsau/WatchedFlix/releases) section.

## Getting Started

It gets a little difficult to manage the shows you've watched on Netflix as they don't have a 'Watched' list feature yet. I have been managing my watched list by using 'My List' and rating a show Thumbs up or down. It's with the Thumbs up or down on the shows in 'My List' I get to know that I've watched a particular show.

This extension once enabled, provides you with a button to `Add to Watched`.

Once marked, even the thumbnail gets labeled with `Watched`.

<!-- Also, there's a `Watched List` tab which will show you the list of all the Shows you've marked `Watched`. -->
